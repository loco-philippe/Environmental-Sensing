# Getting Started

The code used, the results and the explanations are provided through "Jupyter 
Notebook" indicated in link in each chapter.
The Notebook files are 
<a href="https://github.com/loco-philippe/loco-philippe.github.io/tree/main/Example" target="_blank">
stored in Github</a> and can be replayed.

## First Observation

This chapter explain you 
<a href="./Example/first_observation.html" target="_blank">(see the page here)</a> :
    
- how to create a simple and more complex Observation Object
- the different view of the data
- how the ObsJSON is structured 

## Observation for sensor

A sensor sends data to a server with a specific protocol. The server stores and processes the data.
The sensor how use TCP/IP sends the data with ObsJSON format (see above).
This chapter introduces you to the to binary interface and explain you:
<a href="./Example/sensor_observation.html" target="_blank">(see the page here)</a> :
    
- how to encode and decode binary data
- the processes to obtain low data as explain in the "Binary interface" chapter

## Dimension concept

The dimension is an important concept to understand (see chapter above). 

In this example, we show you Observations with differents dimensions (1 to 3).

We also present how Result values without index can be loaded with the 'order' parameter.
